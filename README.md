# Sunburned

## It really is easy on the eyes.

Sunburned is an attempt at making a solarized nvim setup for solarized desktop setups.
I use it on my COSMIC Epoch desktop and find that it really is easier on my eyes than
dark mode themes. I'm maybe in a minority on this one, but still.

## Easy initial setup

```
$ mkdir ~/.config/nvim
$ cd ~/.config/nvim
$ git clone https://github.com/thorhop/sunburned
```

That's it. You're now sunburned.
