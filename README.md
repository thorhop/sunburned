# Sunburned

## It really is easy on the eyes.

You might enjoy the sun... but you might get burned! Hi and welcome to this mish mesh of nvim extensions that forms my daily IDE. It's got a lot o stuff you might like. For instance:

## Features:
* A theme that changes between light (**dayfox**) and dark mode (**nightfox**)!
* **Mason** & **Treesitter**, with LSPs - you'll want for nothing
* **Neo-Tree**, for that sweet UI file manager
* **toggleterm**, for fancy terminal management inside nvim
* **telescope** for quick file search - with ripgrep
* **lazygit** implementation, for lazy gits such as me
* all fetched with the wonderful **lazy** nvim package manager.

## Requirements
* Lua
* NodeJS
* a C compiler (GCC, LLVM)
* and rust, for some reason

## Easy initial setup

```
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ git clone https://github.com/thorhop/sunburned
$ cd sunburned
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

Follow the instructions and you'll be fine... I hope. 

But you might end up... **sunburned**.
